# Dark SynthWave '84 - VS Code theme

This is an amalgamation between two themes,
[Lukin Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukinco.lukin-vscode-theme)
&
[Synthwave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)
plus a few tweaks of my own.

Do you like the theme Synthwave '84? Do you wish there was a dark version of it?

I present Dark SynthWave '84, which has two variations, with and without the
glow effect with the latter being the default.

## But...why?

I wanted something easier on my eyes than the original Synthwave '84.

## I love your font!

Actually its two fonts! they are
[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) &
[Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) see my blog post on
[how I used two fonts simultaneously](https://aaronyoung.dev/blog/2021-01-24-vscode-dual-fonts/)

## Installation

To begin with,
[install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AaronYoung.dark-synthwave-vscode).
This is the way Dark SynthWave '84 is intended to be used day-to-day. If you
want to enable the gratuitous 80s glow, it needs a little extra work to get it
going.

### Disclaimer

VS code doesn't natively support text effects and as a result, the glow is
experimental. It's likely to be buggy and, whilst it looks rad, it isn't
intended for extended use. To enable the glow, the extension has to modify the
internal files of VS Code, so use with caution. Should something go wrong, you
can disable the glow by following the instructions below. If for any reason you
can't open VS Code, you can fix the issue with a fresh install of VS Code.

If you do decide to use the glow effect, you do so at your own risk.

### To enable the glow

Firstly, if you are a Windows user, you may need to run VS Code with
administrator privileges. For Linux and Mac users, Code must not be installed in
a read-only location and you must have write permissions.

To activate the glow, Set your active colour theme to Dark SynthWave '84 - as
now the glow is only active when the base theme is selected. Open your command
palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "**Dark Synthwave
'84: Enable Neon Dreams**". It will prompt you to restart, and when you do the
lights should be on üò≤

#### To customize the glow brightness

Go to **Settings>extensions>Dark Synthwave84: Brightness** and set the value.

The value should be a _float value_ from 0 to 1, where 0.0 is fully transparent.
The default brightness is 0.45. To avoid eye strain, avoid using higher
brightness values for extended periods of time.

To see the changes, you need to rerun the activation function. Open your command
palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "**Dark Synthwave
'84: Enable Neon Dreams**".

Note: Changing the brightness currently only affects the opacity of the glow,
the text will remain white (that may change in future updates). If you want to
disable the glow effect but retain the chrome updates, see below.

#### To enable editor chrome updates, but disable glow

Go to **Settings>extensions>Dark Synthwave84: Disable Glow** and check off the
option to disable the glow effect.

To see the changes, you need to rerun the activation function. Open your command
palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose "**Enable Neon
Dreams**".

### To remove corruption warning and [unsupported] from title-bar

Because enabling the glow modifies core files, VS code will interpret this as
the core being 'corrupted' and you may see an error message on restarting your
editor. You can safely dismiss this message, or remove it entirely with the
[Fix VSCode Checksums](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums "Fix VSCode Checksums")
extension.

Upon installation of 'Fix VSCode Checksums', open the command palette and
execute `Fix Checksums: Apply`. You will need to completely restart VSCode after
execution, reopening without fully exiting might not be enough.

## Updates

Every time you update VS code, you will need to repeat this step to re-enable
the glow.

## Disabling the glow and uninstalling

The glow effect started as a joke and was never intended for long-term coding
sessions. If you want to turn it off, you can disable it at any time by opening
your command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Shift + ‚åò + P` and choose
"**Disable Neon Dreams**".

## Compatibility

This theme is still **very much a work in progress**. I primarily develop in
HTML & CSS, JS, React so, whilst those language sets should look pretty good,
there will likely be issues for other languages. I'll work on adding more
support as I go. If you find anything glaringly wrong, raise an issue and I'll
try to fix it as soon as I can.

## Known Issues

- Some computers, with the glow enabled, have sluggishness when scrolling. This
  depends on the capability of the machine, newer machines can render faster
  than older ones.
